                <li>&nbsp;The Lexus Safety System is available on the market now as standard for most new and used Lexus automobiles. The system consists of several safety elements, a pre-collision system, intelligent high beams, lanes, and a radar cruise control, which provide your car a complete sense of safety. Below, we will describe what each feature does.<br /><br /></li>
                <li>The system for pre-collision is one of the most attractive aspects of the safety system since it has been developing to recognize and notify you of any vehicle or pedestrian on the road approaching your car.<br /><br /></li>
                <li>Visibility is of the essence on the road. You would not notice things or diversions ahead of you without adequate illumination, and here is where intelligent high beams come to play. The system is known to provide additional road lighting in dark locations.

                <li>Lane support is supplied as a standard feature. This technology works to keep you on the road. The camera monitoring the street lines is used by the system. The device will kick and warn you by auditory and visual stimuli when your car goes too near to the bar another lane. The lane departure technology is equipped with a steering aid feature, giving the steering wheel a mild tug to get you back into your lane if the stimuli have not been applied.<br /><br /></li>
                <li>Cruise control is a good function of your <strong>Used Lexus SUV for sale near me</strong>. However, unforeseen circumstances might make your cruise control a risk. With its dynamic radar adaptive cruise control option, Lexus has taken over this.<br /><br /></li>

              <p className="mt-30">Feel free to make a sensible option. Lexus luxury automobiles are recognized for their durability and value and for being one of the cheapest luxury cars. Here are some tips for buying <strong>a Used Lexus SUV for sale near me.</strong><br /><br /></p>
              <ul className="mt-50 w-75">
                <li>Check out the 3 terms before buying the Lexus car.<br /><strong><br />Retail price. The price is the highest of the three values at the dealerships and presumably.<br /></strong><strong><br />Trading price. This is the cheapest of all three costs, and you're going to obtain this used automobile dealing with the dealer for another car<br /></strong><strong><br />Price offered by the seller. This figure falls midway between the retail and trade-in prices, and it represents the price at which a non-dealer individual would sell this old automobile. <br /><br /></strong><br /></li>
                <li>Always check the Carfax report and all maintenance data on the used Lexus you buy from the seller before buying.<br /><br /></li>
                <li>Check the vehicle in and out thoroughly. Take with you a friend who knows automobiles and hire an hour's mechanic.<br /><br /></li>
                <li>Check out the car mileage. On average, around 12k to 15k miles annually are good. Cars are going to be driven less or more. The lesser the distance, the better, but evaluate how the owner handled it.<br /><br /></li>
                <li>Finally, don't go over Lexus's external look. Dealers tend to be gorgeous outside of their vehicles. As previously said, get checked before you purchase it. And when you get a car, you have to have a monthly service schedule to take care of. Because if you do, the value of resales will continue to be high.<br /><br /></li>
